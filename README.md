# Uno Bash Completion

Simple bash completion script for Uno

# Installation

## OS X
1. Download `uno` to `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/uno`. E.g: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusetools/UnoBashCompletion/master/uno > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/uno`
2. Then do `source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/uno`. (Only needed once, all scripts in that directory are loaded automatically.)

## Windows/MSys
1. Download `uno` to `/etc/uno-completion.bash`, e.g `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusetools/UnoBashCompletion/master/uno
 > /etc/uno-completion.bash`
2. Then do `source /etc/uno-completion.bash`. If you want this for new shells as well (you probably do), add this line to your .bashrc file as well.
